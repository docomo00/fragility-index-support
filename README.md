## 📱 About the App

This app helps researchers and clinicians assess the statistical robustness of binary outcomes in clinical trials using the **Fragility Index** — a method described by Walsh et al. (J Clin Epidemiol, 2014).

It simulates minimal outcome perturbations using Fisher’s Exact Test to determine how many changes would render a statistically significant result non-significant.
